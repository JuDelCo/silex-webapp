Silex - webapp framework
=================

This project has a configured webapp base code using silex, some symfony 2 components and some CSS & JavaScript libraries / frameworks to make the coding of a complex webapp fairly easy.

There are a lot of libraries (in PHP, JS and CSS) made by me to add new features and functions.

New features (in addition to Silex/Symfony/Other ones):
- [PHP] Custom controller basecode to ease the development (lot of shortcut functions)
- [PHP] Custom firewall to allow routes by roles (alternative to symfony/security component)
- [PHP] Lib to generate and send emails (using swiftmailer)
- [PHP] Lib to generate and download Excels easily (using phpexcel)
- [PHP] Lib to handle uploaded files and store them
- [PHP] Lib to make SQL requests (using doctrine) (warning: plain SQL, not using ORM)
- [PHP] Twig: New functions to render HTML tags to include CSS and JS libraries
- [PHP] Lib to validate data variables (alternative to symfony/validator component)
- [PHP] Custom error handler (show and save logs in DB and sends them in an email)
- [PHP] Added console functions for to clear the cache and show all controller routes
- [PHP] PSR-4 autoloader enabled
- [Twig] Base templates (Twitter Bootstrap 3 ready)
- [App] Simple app to register and authenticate users
- [JS] Downloaded a set of jQuery and Twitter Bootstrap 3 extensions
- [JS] New jquery.util & jQuery.util.form libs with util functions
- [CSS] Downloaded a set of Twitter Bootstrap 3 extensions
- [CSS] Added main.css with helper classes and base style (using Twitter Bootstrap 3)
- All vendor components (silex, symfony 2, etc) updated to latest versions
- A lot more! (I dont want to do this list bigger xD)
