Silex - webapp framework
=================

This project has a configured webapp base code using silex, some symfony 2 components and some CSS & JavaScript libraries / frameworks to make the coding of a complex webapp fairly easy.

There are a lot of libraries (in PHP, JS and CSS) made by me to add new features and functions.

New features (in addition to Silex/Symfony/Other ones):
- [PHP] Custom controller basecode to ease the development (lot of function shortcuts)
- [PHP] Custom firewall to allow routes by roles (alternative to security component)
- [PHP] Lib to generate and send emails (using swiftmailer)
- [PHP] Lib to generate and download Excels (using phpexcel)
- [PHP] Lib to handle uploaded files
- [PHP] Lib to make SQL requests (using doctrine)
- [PHP] New functions to render CSS and JS libraries (using twig)
- [PHP] Lib to validate variables (alternative to validator component)
- [PHP] New custom error handler (save logs in DB and sends an email)
- [PHP] Added functions to console for to clear the cache and show all routes
- [PHP] PSR-4 autoloader enabled
- [Twig] Base templates (twitter bootstrap 3 ready)
- [App] Simple app to register and authenticate users
- [JS] Downloaded a set of jquery and t.bootstrap 3 extensions
- [JS] New jquery.util & jquery.util.form libs with util functions
- [CSS] Downloaded a set of t.bootstrap 3 extensions
- [CSS] Added main.css with helper classes and base style (using t.bootstrap 3)
- All vendor components (silex, symfony 2, etc) updated to latest versions
